# IsyMonitor

Script is run by executing `LogEvents.py`.
You must satisfy this dependency:
https://github.com/NickBorgers/IsyMonitor/blob/master/LogEvents.py#L10
I have my own fork of the library for which I have created a PR:
https://github.com/NickBorgers/ISYlib-python

FYI: I didn't really write this for other people to use, but I'm leaving the source open. The code could use a refactor into packages, but it's working fine for most of what I want from it at the moment.
